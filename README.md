# Lights Out in the Eye of the Storm
A Data Analysis of Power Outages and Hurricanes

by Russel Luber ([rluber@ucsd.edu](mailto:rluber@ucsd.edu))


## Introduction
In this project, I worked on a dataset about major power outage events in the continental United States. This dataset can be accessed online [here](https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages), courtesy of Purdue University's Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure. An article detailing the data dictionary for the dataset can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918307182).

The dataset contains information about major power outage events, as well as geographical data, electricity consumption patterns, and economic characteristics related to said outages.


### Motivation
I experienced many power outages growing up in the Philippines. Sometimes due to [typhoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon). Other times due to insufficient electrical supply. We would always call them "[brownouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownout_(electricity))" no matter the cause. 

I chose this dataset because I have experienced power outages myself - from outages that lasted a couple hours to blackouts that spanned a couple months at a time. When I hear the phrase "power outage," it brings back memories of my childhood, distinct stretches of time tinged with boredom and inconvenience but also marked with death and destruction.

In my experience, power outages were almost always caused by typhoons. Or as we like to call them here in North America: hurricanes.
