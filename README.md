# Hurricane Outage Events
by Russel Luber ([rluber@ucsd.edu](mailto:rluber@ucsd.edu))


## Introduction
In this project, I worked on a dataset about major power outage events in the continental United States. This dataset can be accessed online [here](https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages), courtesy of Purdue University's Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure. An article detailing the data dictionary for the dataset can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918307182).

The dataset contains information about major power outage events, as well as geographical data, electricity consumption patterns, and economic characteristics related to said outages.


### Motivation
I experienced many power outages growing up in the Philippines. Sometimes due to [typhoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon). Other times due to insufficient electrical supply. We would always call them "[brownouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownout_(electricity))" no matter the cause. 

I chose this dataset because I have experienced power outages myself - from outages that lasted a couple hours to blackouts that spanned a couple months at a time. Power outages were distinct stretches of time of boredom and inconvenience that I remember from my childhood. In my experience, they were almost always caused by a typhoons. Or as North Americans call it: hurricanes.
