# Hurricane Outages
by Russel Luber ([rluber@ucsd.edu](mailto:rluber@ucsd.edu))


## Introduction
In this project, I worked on a dataset about major power outage risks in the continental United States. This dataset can be accessed online [here](https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages), through Purdue University's Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure webpage.

The dataset contains information about major power outages, as well as geographical data, electricity consumption patterns, and economic characteristics related to said outages.
